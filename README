This is a sample application for an article I wrote at gihyo.jp (http://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/modern-perl/0009) to explain Jifty's basic usage. As the application name (MyApp) suggests, this is not for installation nor ready to use in general. Lots of things are intentionally left untouched as I don't want this sample to be too complicated.

That said, this application is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
